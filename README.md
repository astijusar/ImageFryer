# ImageFryer

A simple website used to "deep fry" images.

[Deep fried memes](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deep-fried-memes "Deep fried memes") are a style of meme where an image is run through dozens of filters to the point where the image appears grainy, washed-out, and strangely colored.

In this website the deep frying process is simplified by only using 2 filters:
- Saturation
- Sharpness (also called fry level in the website)

Restrictions:
- only .png, .jpg and .jpeg images are allowed.
- maximum image size is 2mb
- image upload is limited to once every five seconds

Example result:
